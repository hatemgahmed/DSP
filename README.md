# DSP
A Library for efficient Digital Signal Processing on Microcontrollers using C++

# Features:
1- Alpha Filter Implementation

2- Kalman Filter Implementation

3- Chebyshev HP and LP filters using http://www.schwietering.com/jayduino/filtuino/

4- Decaying Exponential Drift Eliminator (Tested only on originally constant signals)

5- Signal Rectifier eliminates noise and drift using Drift Eliminator and Alpha Filter

6- A trigger-based measurement implementation for ultrasonic sensors (Stopping delay on active polling for output change)
